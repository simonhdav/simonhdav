## Shipping: SFXScout (macOS)
SFXScout is a macOS app for browsing and searching your local SFX library with fast auditioning.

- Download: https://github.com/simonhdav/SFXScout-Public-Releases/releases
- Feedback form: https://forms.gle/gAY71ercmhJhNrQ56

### Quick start
1. Download the latest `SFXScout-*.zip` from Releases
2. Unzip, then drag `SFXScout.app` into Applications
3. First launch: right-click → Open (Gatekeeper)
4. Add your SFX folder(s) and let indexing finish

### What I want feedback on
- Library size + how long initial indexing took
- Searches that felt “wrong” (and the query you used)
- Any crashes/glitches + what you were doing right before

### Privacy
Runs locally. Your audio stays on your machine.

## Focus (now / next)
- Onboarding + help
- Improved tagging + organization tools
- Later: duplicate detection + smarter metadata

## Contact
- GitHub Releases + Feedback link above is best for SFXScout notes.
